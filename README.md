# BaseBot
BaseBot is a complete rewrite of [BarebonesFRC](https://github.com/ewpratten/barebonesfrc) with 2 goals. Do it right, and do it fast. The entire codebase is written in pure c/c++ and some components are being optimized further using ARMv7-a assembly.

## What about BarebonesFRC?
We have not yet decided what we are going to do with the BarebonesFRC project. As of now, we are maintaining both repos, and fully support both. The decision of which one to keep will be made shortly before 2019 Kickoff.
